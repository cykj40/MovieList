# MovieList

MovieList is a simple, full-stack movie app I built as part of my journey learning backend programming with Go (Golang). The backend is written in Go, while the frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with modern Web Components for a clean, interactive experience.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Try it out here, deployed on Render:
